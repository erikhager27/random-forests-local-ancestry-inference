# Welcome to our eBook!

This bookdown document serves as a digital artifact of our final presentation on Random Forests and Local Ancestry Inference as part of our Statistical Genetics capstone course at Macalester College. We intend to illustrate how machine learning techniques can help provide useful insights in the field of genetics, focusing on random forest modeling in particular.

Beginning in Chapter 2, we provide an introduction to basic genetics, genome-wide association studies and local ancestry inference. In Chapter 3, we discuss how machine learning can help accomplish genetic inferences through the use of decision trees. Building off of this discussion in Chapter 4, we discuss ensemble learning and the advantages of extending tree building with bootstrap aggregation and random forest modeling. In our final section, we hope to unify our project by applying the material and techniques discussed in previous chapters to a small case study using a toy genetic dataset.
